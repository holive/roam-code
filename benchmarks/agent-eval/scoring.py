"""
Agent Quality Score (AQS) — Composite scoring system.

Combines roam metrics + structural checks into a single 0-100 score.

Score breakdown (100 points total):
  - Roam Health Score:    40 pts  (0-100 scaled to 0-40)
  - Code Quality:         25 pts  (dead code, complexity, coupling penalties)
  - Architecture:         15 pts  (cycles, tangle ratio, file structure)
  - Testing:              15 pts  (test existence, count, coverage proxy)
  - Project Completeness:  5 pts  (README, build config, builds, runs)
