--- CONTINUOUS CODE QUALITY ---
You have access to roam-code tools (MCP) for continuous code quality validation.
Use them throughout development, not just at the end:

- After creating file structure: check with roam health
- After implementing core logic: check complexity and coupling
- After adding all features: check for dead code and cycles
- Before finalizing: run full health check, aim for score above 80

Use roam tools proactively as you build. Fix issues as they arise rather than
accumulating technical debt. Do not finalize until health score is above 80.
