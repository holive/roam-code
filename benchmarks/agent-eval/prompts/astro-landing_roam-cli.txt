--- CODE QUALITY VALIDATION ---
After completing the project, validate and improve your code quality using roam-code:

1. Run `roam init` to index the codebase
2. Run `roam health` — aim for a score above 80
3. Run `roam dead` — remove any dead/unused code found
4. Run `roam complexity` — refactor any functions with cognitive complexity > 15
5. Run `roam cycles` — eliminate any circular dependencies
6. Run `roam gate` — ensure all quality gates pass
7. Run `roam coupling` — reduce high coupling where possible

Iterate until roam reports clean results. Do not stop until health score is above 80.
